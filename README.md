<h1>Number Guessing Game in C</h1>
<hr><p>This project is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in the C programming language. The program randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100, and the user attempts to guess it. After each guess, the program informs the user whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also counts the total number of guesses and displays it once the correct number is guessed.</p><h2>General Information</h2>

<h3>1. About the Project</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in C. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.</p><ul>
<li>
<h3>2. Problem It Solves</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This project provides an interactive way to practice fundamental programming concepts such as input/output handling, control structures (loops and conditionals), and random number generation. It also serves as a basic console game that users can enjoy without needing complex setup or dependencies.</p><ul>
<li>
<h3>3. Purpose of the Project</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To help beginners learn and apply basic C programming concepts.</li>
<li>To demonstrate how to implement randomness and user interaction in a console application.</li>
<li>To provide a simple, fun, and educational game that can be extended or used as a learning tool.</li>
<li>To offer a foundational project that can be built upon with GUIs or other features.</li>
</ul><h2>Features</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>Language: C</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Compiler: GCC or any standard C compiler</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Platform: Windows (compiled .exe file included), but source code is portable and can run on any OS with a C compiler.</li>
</ul><h2>Setup</h2>
<hr><p>A system with a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC, MinGW for Windows).
Windows/Linux/Mac operating system supported.</p><h5>Steps</h5><ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Download or Clone the Project    You can download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository or clone it using: git clone https://github.com/GARJE-01/Guess_the_number.git</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Navigate to the Project Folder  Open your terminal or command prompt.  Change directory to the project folder:  cd Guess_the_number</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Run Using the Precompiled Executable (Windows) If you are on Windows and the .exe file is provided: ./guessthenum.exe  Or just double-click the guessthenum.exe file in the folder.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>(Optional) Compile From Source If you want to build the executable yourself:  Make sure you have a C compiler (like GCC or MinGW) installed.  Compile the source code using: gcc guessthenum.c -o guessthenum.exe    # Windows gcc guessthenum.c -o guessthenum        # Linux/Mac   Run the compiled program:./guessthenum.exe   # Windows ./guessthenum       # Linux/Mac</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<ol start="5">
<li>Start Playing Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the randomly generated number.  The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low until you find the correct number.  After guessing correctly, it will display how many attempts you took.</li>
